# Credit Risk Modeling using R

* This project uses R programming to explore a loans data from an open source data repository and understand how the loan defaulter factors and their relation to each other looks like.
* We also try to clean the data before fitting the data into different models like Decision Tree, Linear Regression and compare the scores of these models to predict if an individual is going to default or not.
